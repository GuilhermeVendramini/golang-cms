# How to use

Uncomment the line "demo.User()" inside of main.go.

"demo.User()" will gerenate a demo user:

> Name: admin
> Email: admin@admin.com
> Password: admin

Execute:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

After running for the first time, comment "demo.User()" otherwise that will generate a new user again.

**Enjoy!**
